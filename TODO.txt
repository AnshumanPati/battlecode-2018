    - Note: this is a CUSTOM package layout; it has nothing to do with pip or gradle, etc.
      We download it straight from the website.

- player code layout: 
    - Can't use shell anymore
    - layout:
        - setup.py: run before game starts
        - run.py: run when game starts
        - ...
    - java code could just shell out to gradle from setup.py and run.py

- docker:
    - we can patch it in later if we want

- player manager:
    - checks website for updates
    - `battlecode update`
        - goes to website and gets most recent version of game

            - Mac: $HOME/Documents/Battlecode/1.0.0
            - Linux: $HOME/Documents/Battlecode/1.0.0
